//The CSE dept is organizing a tech fest with so many exciting events. By participating in an event,you can claim for activity points as stipulated by KTU. Each event i gives you A[i] activity points where A is an array.If you are not allowed to participate in more than k events, whatâ€™s the max number of points that you can earn?

                int temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
